- 👋 Hi, I’m @techwithallie
- 👀 I’m interested in web design, healthy living, good playlists, and family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, C# programming, and refreshing my HTML and CSS knowledge in this class! I don't know too much HTML or CSS, but I've learned the basics using courses, and I look forwarding to learning more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tips for navigating programs like GitHub, Visual Studio, etc. All of these tools have been a lot for me to wrap my head around.
- 📫 How to reach me: our class slack chat
